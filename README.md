# TextToSpeechEditor

In this project, we made a desktop application in javafx.

We designed both the front-end and the back-end.

It is an editor made for people with disabilities to read.

The user can:
- open a document
- edit a document
- save a document
- convert to speech the text of the document
- start recording the sequences
- replay
- end recording
- change the volume
- change the pitch of the audio

Also the documents are decoded while opened, and encoding while saving them on the disk for security reasons
